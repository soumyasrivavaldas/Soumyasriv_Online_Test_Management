        - View their test results.
2. **Functionality**
    
    - **Admin**
        - Manage tests (CRUD operations).
        - Manage test questions and answers.
        - View user submissions and results.
    - **User**
        - Register and log in to the system.
        - View available tests.

3. **Database**
    
    - Use MySQL for storing user data, tests, questions, answers, and results.
4. **Authentication**
    - Implement user authentication and authorization.
5. **Docker** (Good to Have)
